# Deliverables
* TTree with
    * Jet information
        * Energy
        * Position
        * Event plane
        * Jet constituants
* Histograms of
    * Jet momentum distribution
    * Event plane distributions
        * Uncorrected
        * Phi corrected
        * Phi/Psi corrected
    * Track cut QA


* add trigger cut (post?)

* 3/9 Questions before running over full data set
    * Do we have a low pt cut on jets?  Do we care about every jet in every event?
    * Why don't I have negative pt on my background subtracted jets?

* 3/18
    * Add pileup cuts
    * Add trigger selections
        * Only use minbias for corrections
        * Only look for jets in bht1_vpd30
            * But for now all?
        * Eventually only use events where a jet fired a trigger
    * Acceptance cuts (post probably)
